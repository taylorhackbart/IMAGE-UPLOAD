# IMAGE UPLOAD TEMPLATE

## Description
I have created a drag and drop image uploader that allows multiple image uploads from a desktop, tablet or mobile device. This allows a user to delete photos upon upload, as well as rearrange the order in which images will be displayed. The first image on the list will always be the image displayed on the "View Uploads" page. Feel free to try out my app <a href="https://image-upload-template.herokuapp.com/" > here </a> and please only upload photos that you are comfortable being displayed on a live site.

## Usage
Below will show a basic walk through of the app:

Home Page:

Example of file upload method:

Allowing deletion or rearranging order of photos:

Using a carasoul, it will allow the user to look through the photos and shows how many photos are in this collection:

Clicking "View Uploads" in the upper right hand corner of the screen, takes the user to a page that will display the first photo from every collection. If a user submits an empty upload (no images) these will automatically be filtered out and will not appear on the page. By clicking on a photo, it will lead the user to see all photos that were uploaded in the collection:

## Installation
To use this image upload, one must install React, Mongoose, React Icons, React-DND, and React-DND-Beautiful. By running npm install in the command line, all dependencies should be installed in the correct package.JSON files to run this app.
