# IMAGE UPLOAD TEMPLATE

## Description
I have created a drag and drop image uploader that allows multiple image uploads from a desktop, tablet or mobile device. This allows a user to delete photos upon upload, as well as rearrange the order in which images will be displayed. The first image on the list will always be the image displayed on the "View All Uploads" page

## Usage


## Installation
To use this image upload, one must install React, Mongoose, React Icons, React-DND, and React-DND-Beautiful. By running npm install in the command line, all dependencies should be installed in the correct package.JSON files to run this app.
